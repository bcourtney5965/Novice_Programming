# My answer

# Though I'm still ltrying to wrap my head around the idea of an 
# API, and how to use one, I find that I ike the one at 
# http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/.  Perhaps its the clean design 
# or the fact that through referencing it I have become most familiar 
# with it.  Whatever the reason I find it most helpful to me at 
# at this point. Since I have not ever worked in rails and since we 
# have not gone over it yet in this class yet I have not even looked at 
# a rails API and therefore have no preference at this time
