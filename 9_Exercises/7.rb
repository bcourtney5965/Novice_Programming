# My answer
# Both store information, an array's information is however retrieved by
# referanceing its slot number - or its position in the array.  In a 
# hash the information (or more appropraitely "value") is stored, accessed, 
# and referred to by its key

# Your answer - learning with my fingers
# The major differance between an array and a hash is that a hash contains 
# a key value pair for referencing by key
